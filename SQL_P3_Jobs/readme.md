- **SQL server**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Git & Github**

# Analysis
Each query for this project aimet at investigating specific aspects of data analyst job market.
Here is how I approach each question:
### 1. Top paying data analyst job
To identify the highest paying jobs. I filtered data analyst postions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This highlight the top paying opportunities for data analyst job seekers.
```sql
SELECT TOP(10)
        name as company_name,
        job_id,
        job_title,
        job_location,
        job_schedule_type,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date
FROM
        job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
        job_title_short = 'data analyst' AND job_location = 'anywhere'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC;
```
Here is the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide salary range:** Top 10 range from $184,000 to $650,000 which indicates significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse employer:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, AT&T are among those offering the highest salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job title variety:** High diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles within data analytics.

### 2. Skills required for top-paying roles
To understand what specific skills are required the most, I joined the job postings table with the skills table.
```sql
WITH top_10 AS (
SELECT TOP(10)
        name as company_name,
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg
FROM
        job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
        job_title_short = 'data analyst' AND job_location = 'anywhere'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
)

SELECT top_10.*,
        skills
FROM top_10
JOIN skills_job_dim sk
ON sk.job_id = top_10.job_id
JOIN skills_dim 
ON skills_dim.skill_id = sk.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC;
```
Quick snapshot based on the result:
* SQL is leading, then Python follows closely.
* Tableau is also highly sought after.
* Other skills like R, Snowflake, Pandas, Excel show varying degrees of demand.

### 3. In-demand skills for Data analysts
This query helped identified the skills most frequently required in job postings.
```sql
SELECT top (5) 
    skills,
    COUNT(sk.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact as fact
JOIN skills_job_dim sk
ON sk.job_id = fact.job_id
JOIN skills_dim 
ON skills_dim.skill_id = sk.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data analyst' AND job_work_from_home = 1
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
Here is the breakdown of most demanded skills in 2023:
* SQL and Excel are fundamental, emphasizing the importance of strong foundational skills in data processing and manipulation.
* Programming and Visualization tools like Python, Tableau and Power BI are essential showing the importance of technical skills in data storytelling.

| Skills     | Demand Count |
|------------|--------------|
| SQL        | 7291         |
| Excel      | 4611         |
| Python     | 4330         |
| Tableau    | 3745         |
| Power BI   | 2609         |

*Table of demand for top 5 skills in data analyst job postings (remote)*

### 4. Most optinal skills to have
Exploring the average yearly salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills have the highest paying.
```sql
SELECT TOP(25)
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg),0) as avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact as fact
JOIN skills_job_dim sk
ON sk.job_id = fact.job_id
JOIN skills_dim 
ON skills_dim.skill_id = sk.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data analyst' AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
Quick insight:
- **Niche and Emerging Technologies Pay the Most:** Skills in SVN, Solidity, and Couchbase lead the top paying list, indicating high demand for expertise in specialized and emerging technologies.
- **Machine Learning and DevOps Skills Are Highly Valued:** Proficiency in machine learning frameworks (e.g., MXNet, Keras) and DevOps tools (e.g., VMware, Terraform) commands high salaries, reflecting their critical role in data analytics.
- **Diverse Skill Set Needed for High Pay:** A mix of programming languages (e.g., Golang, Scala), database management (e.g., Cassandra), and version control/collaboration tools (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket) highlights the broad range of skills that contribute to higher earnings in data analyst roles.
